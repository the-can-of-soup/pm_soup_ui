## Widgets

SoupUI is based on an inheritance structure. You can think of it like a tree of nodes, where each node has one parent and zero or more children. The nodes in SoupUI are called "widgets", and the very top node is called the "top widget". These widgets are all stored in the `SoupUI: widgets` variable.
